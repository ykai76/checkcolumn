why use physical emission intensity to set net zero target

1. Introduction:

Physical Emission Intensity: The amount of emissions (e.g., CO2) per unit of physical output (e.g., tons of steel, kilowatts of electricity).
Financed Emission Lending Intensity: The emissions generated by activities that are financed through lending (e.g., loans, investments), per unit of financial capital lent.

2. Comparison:

Physical Emission Intensity:
Focuses on direct emissions from production processes.
Encourages efficient production methods and the use of cleaner technologies.
Useful for measuring and comparing emissions across similar sectors.
Tied directly to tangible production outputs.
Financed Emission Lending Intensity:
Measures emissions financed through lending activities, providing insights into the environmental impact of financial institutions' portfolios.
Allows lenders to assess the environmental risks and opportunities associated with their financing.
Useful for encouraging sustainable finance and investment practices.
May not reflect direct emissions reductions or improvements in production processes.

3. Benefits of Choosing Physical Emission Intensity:

Direct Control Over Emissions:
Businesses can directly manage and improve their emission outputs through cleaner production methods.
Clear Benchmarking:
Standardized comparisons across similar industries are possible, enabling better goal setting and progress tracking.
Immediate Impact on Emissions:
Improvements in production efficiency can have immediate effects on reducing emissions.

4. Considerations for Financed Emission Lending Intensity:

Focus on Financial Portfolios:
Helps lenders and investors assess the environmental impact of their funding decisions.
Broader Scope:
Considers emissions from a variety of sectors and industries within a financial portfolio.
Challenges:
May not directly incentivize emissions reductions in production processes.
